# Snake Game :snake: 

This is a simple version of the well-known Snake game in Python, using the [Turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). The player must guide the snake with the arrow keys to make it eat food . Every time the snake eats food, it increases in length. The game ends when the snake head touches its tail or the borders.
